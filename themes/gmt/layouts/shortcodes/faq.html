	<summary class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>How much of a time commitment does the Vanilla JS Academy involve?</strong></summary>
	<p>This program is for people who are <em>serious</em> about learning JavaScript. The more you put into it, the more you'll get out of it.</p>
	<p>The amount of time required varies a bit from the beginning to end of the program, and based on how much experience you have already. Generally speaking, expect each project to take 30 minutes to an hour (plus maybe 15 minutes of reading with the lessons) near the start of the program, and up to two or three hours near the end.</p>

	<summary class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Will you (Chris) be available to help me if I get stuck?</strong></summary>
	<p>Absolutely! I want to make sure you succeed, and actively participate in the Discord community answering questions and helping students get unstuck.</p>
	<p>In my experience, not being able to get help is one of the biggest reasons people give up when they're trying to learn JavaScript. This workshop exists is to make sure that doesn't happen.</p>

<details class="margin-bottom-small">
	<summary class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Do I need any special tools or equipment for the Vanilla JS Academy?</strong></summary>
	<p>All you need to go through the program and work on the projects is a modern web browser and a text editor (I recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>). The program materials come in a mix streaming, captioned HD video and plain text, so you can read and watch any device you own.</p>
</details>

<details class="margin-bottom-small">
	<summary class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Do I need any prior knowledge or experience to participate in the Vanilla JS Academy?</strong></summary>
	<p>Ideally you're comfortable working with HTML and CSS already. Experience with another library or framework (like jQuery, React, and so on) is helpful but not required.</p>
	<p>If you're brand new to JavaScript, the program includes optional lessons on some fundamentals, and will help you kick-start your journey to JavaScript mastery! If you have any specific questions, though, please email me at <a href="mailt:&#099;&#104;&#114;&#105;&#115;&#064;&#103;&#111;&#109;&#097;&#107;&#101;&#116;&#104;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#115;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;?subject=Vanilla%20JS%20Academy:%20General%20Questions">&#099;&#104;&#114;&#105;&#115;&#064;&#103;&#111;&#109;&#097;&#107;&#101;&#116;&#104;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#115;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>

<details class="margin-bottom-small">
	<summary class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>What's the difference between the Vanilla JS Academy and your pocket guides?</strong></summary>
	<p>The guides try to cover all of the important details on a particular topic, then walk you through a project to help you remember what you learned. Academy is about learning from doing, and gives you just enough information to get started on projects without giving you all the answers.</p>
	<p>If you learn best from experience and building things, Academy is a great fit. If you learn best by being guided through a problem, Academy would probably be a waste of money.</p>
</details>

<details class="margin-bottom-small">
	<summary class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>I already purchased your pocket guides. Will I learn anything new from the Vanilla JS Academy?</strong></summary>
	<p>There's definitely some overlap in content, but the focus of the Vanilla JS Academy is on teaching you to “think in JavaScript,” through experiential, project-based learning.</p>
	<p>If you've already read the pocket guides, you'll be able to focus more on thinking through problems and less on, "what method do I need to do this?"</p>
</details>

<details class="margin-bottom-small">
	<summary class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Are there any rules or requirements for participating in the Discord community?</strong></summary>
