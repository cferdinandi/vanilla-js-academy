## Build an ecommerce platform from scratch

For this workshop, you'll build an ecommerce platform for Sparrow Photography Studio, a pirate-themed photographer.

Over the course of several weeks, you'll build an online store front, add a shopping cart, and build a checkout system powered by Stripe. Then, you'll create a dashboard you can use to manage your product inventory, secured behind a login screen.
