## How It Works

_Academy for Teams_ includes the same content and structure as [the public workshops](/#the-workshops), with some added benefits:

- **Flexible Scheduling.** The program start date and office hours can be tailored to the needs of your team.
- **Private & Team Focused.** Since only members of your team are in the program, I can really focus on the unique challenges facing your organization during office hours.
- **Extra Support.** I can provide additional office hours sessions, more learning resources, and post-training support to maximize your ROI.
