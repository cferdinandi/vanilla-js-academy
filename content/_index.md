## The Workshops

Workshops run concurrently, and are designed to be taken one at a time. Don't sign up for both during the same session.

- **Every other day, you get a project to work on**, 1-3 short lessons that provide some background, and a template to help you get started.
- **On the in-between days, I share my approach to the project** and some of the common challenges and “gotchas” that students often run into.

If you get stuck, there’s a **24/7 private Slack channel** exclusively for students, and **video office hours** every few weeks.
